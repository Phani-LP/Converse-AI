## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ConverseAI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate 
   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Instead of hardcoding sensitive information like the **Google Gemini API Key**, use environment variables for better security.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the API key:
     ```
     # .env
     GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key
     ```

   - Install the `python-decouple` package to manage environment variables:
     ```bash
     pip install python-decouple
     ```

   - Update your `settings.py` or a dedicated configuration file to load the API key securely:
     ```python
     # filepath: [settings.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
      decfromouple import config

     API_KEY = config('GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY')
     ```

   This approach ensures that sensitive information is not exposed in the source code and can be managed securely across different environments.

5. **Apply Migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
6. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
7. **Access the Application:**<br>
   Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
